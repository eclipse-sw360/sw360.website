In most cases, software today is not built from scratch, but rather assembled from various prepackaged third-party software components. As a result, organizations face the following challenges:

* Verifying various aspects of compliance when using third-party software components: license compliance, ECC checks, IP assessments, etc.
* Sharing knowledge about software components and their qualities. For example, which software components should be recommended, which should be phased out based on which criteria?
* Providing a broad overview of the components used: An organization and its supply chain management must have information about which assets are integrated into which products or solutions.

These three main use cases target different roles in an organization: quality managers, software developers, legal counsels, software architects, R&D managers etc. However, all these use cases share a common need for a central hub that manages insights into software components.

SW360 is an open source software project licensed under the EPL-1.0 that provides both a web application and a repository to collect, organize and make available information about software components. It establishes a central hub for software components in an organization. SW360 allows for

* tracking components used by a project/product,
* assessing security vulnerabilities,
* maintaining license obligations,
* enforcing policies, and
* generating legal documents.

For example, SW360 can trigger a clearing process in the open source compliance tool FOSSology and import the resulting clearing reporting. Data is either stored in SW360â€™s database or on the fly imported from external sources. In future we plan to have federations of SW360 instances that share selected information. Besides its web-based UI, all functionality of SW360 is available through an API that allows an integration into existing devops tools.
