After successful , Then if you open the server with the URL `https://localhost:8888/` the following screen should appear:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/1.png" >}}

Note that the actual image changes with every liferay version. If there is weird html output without images and plain text, then likely some port settings did not work and the pages generated have wrong URLs inside.

Sign in_the icon_the upper left corner. If you did not change the values in `configuration.rb`the default login is `setup@sw360.org` and `sw360fossy`.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/2.png" >}}

After login the sw360 is not setup, thus the server does not display much, but a screen like the following:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/3.png" >}}

Then, in `Configuration` >  `Instance Settings` > `User Authentication` > `General` to disable all kind of auto login to make sure only authenticated users can log in. You may want to switch off the e-mail verification, because for most of the development times it will not be of much value.

# Setup SW360 for Liferay: Import *.lar Files

For the setup of SW360 in Liferay, the portal description files, `*.lar` files need not be imported. there is no way except from doing this in the UI. If we are wrong with this, please let us know, because it is very annoying that these ever occurring steps cannot be automated with Liferay.

In order to go ahead, switch to the `SW360` area where you can apply site settings:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/12.png" >}}

The go into >  `Publishing` > `Import` which shows like this:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/13.png" >}}

Then, click on the plus sign in order to import the *.lar file for public pages. You will find the lar files in the [frontend/configuration](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/tree/master/frontend/configuration) folder of the sw360 repository.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/14.png" >}}

As for import settings, follow the selection as shown on the screenshot. It is very important that for the `PublicPages.lar` file the selection `Public Pages` is made.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/15.png" >}}

Importing permission makes sure that pages are visible according to users rights. For public pages, it is irrelevant_the moment. Overwriting and the write as current user needs to be selected.

After successful importing, the same steps shall be repeated for the `PrivatePages.lar` file.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/16.png" >}}

Make sure that `Private Pages` is selected. Follow the other selections made as shown on the screenshot ... importing permissions ... mirror with overwriting, use the current author ...

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/17.png" >}}


If you click then the liferay logo_the upper left corner where the SW360 is, you will return to the application and the following screen should appear:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/18.png" >}}

You can close the left menu area by clicking on the upper left icon:

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/19.png" >}}

Click `Start` to open the private pages. You are still logged in, so the setup account is used to view the pages.

__Important__ The setup account does not belong to a group. Thus, not all view are functional because they require a group membership to work correctly.

# Import User Accounts for Testing

Click the SW360 `Admin` menu which is_the right and selection the `User` item.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/21.png" >}}

At the bottom of that view, select a User file to import for testing. Skip it if you will create users differently. You can find a [user account import file](https://github.com/sw360/sw360vagrant/blob/master/shared/test_users_with_passwords_12345.csv) to import in the `sw360vagrant` project in the folder `shared`. After the user have been imported successfully, they should appear in the table view.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/22.png" >}}

After the user have been imported successfully, they should appear in the table view. You can logout for now and use one of the just added accounts (see below):

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/23.png" >}}

# Real Login

One example user is `user@sw360.org` with the password `12345`. Note that in the import file with the example accounts, the passwort is provided with a hash. If you would like to generate new (salted) hashes, you can change your password and export the user list using the same portlet where you have imported the users. This functionality can be also used to migrate accounts between servers.

{{< figure src="/sw360/img/sw360screenshots/deploy74/24.png" >}}

After the successful login, SW360 will look as follows.
