### Policy

* Review points should involve one person from another angle (not just the person you were sitting together with anyways)
* Limit items in review to 5, try to coordinate 
* Using Github assignments to issues or pull requests
* Open review items require conversation

# Definition of Done

* File headers in file OK
  * EPL-2.0 license header
  * Or, if the file is too small, configuration file: license note (see code style)
  * Copyright and author

* Create Branches for sw360
  * Please use conventional branch names for sw360 [Dev-Branches]({{< relref path="Dev-Branches.md">}})
  
* Avoid (serious) compiler warnings
  * Squash your commits into one or more logical units of work. No dozens of hourly/daily commits in your pull request, please
  * Rebase onto current master so that a fast forward merge is possible
  * That means that merge to master is prepared

* No breaking test
  * Unit testing as it is already present
  * You have more - use them!

* New test
  * For new / added functionality

* Documentation
  * in the Githuib Wiki-Section, if you have done something new
  * At least a technical note for newly added functionality

* Commit style
  * try to squash commits. In the ideal case, a feature is contained in one commit.
  * try to use conventional changelog for commit messages. [Dev-Semantic-Commits]({{< relref path="Dev-Semantic-Commits.md" >}})

# Review

Review basically checks for the D-o-D items, in particular

* Code style, not really formatting, but issues like style attributes in HTML tags or exception handling useful
* Design / architecture issues
* Community contribution suitability
* Issue coverage (does it actually solve the problem?)
* Add to commit message of merge commit explicitly:
```
review-by:email@domain.com
```
and
```
tested-by:email@domain.com
```

# Licensing and File Header

All files contributed require headers - this will ensure the license and copyright clearing at the end. Also, all contributions must have the same license as the original source.

If a file has relevant functionality, note that we should move to Eclipse 2.0
