# 5.0 Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability is a security flaw, glitch, or weakness found in software code that could be exploited by an attacker (threat source). The Vulnerabilities page lists all the vulnerabilities that are available in SW360. The Vulnerabilities are typically synced from SVM tools but can also be manually managed. They are listed independently without any relation to their linked projects/components/releases initially.

To open the Vulnerabilities page, click on the **Vulnerabilities tab** from the main menu.
