Starting 2026, Google has strong advice about the usage of Generative AI in the
GSoC program. Please check them at:
* For Mentoring Orgs: [Usage of AI tooling in Google Summer of Code 2026 (for
  Mentoring Orgs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jglptdn_DovOxjwuhzORn3QhYoeBcToS7ymk3IIWHKY/edit?usp=sharing)
* For Contributors: [Guidance for GSoC Contributors using AI tooling in GSoC
  2026 doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9GcIBnNXPNO6klRQvU8pL8-uV6afzLo6JUAM299suA/edit?usp=sharing)

Based on the suggestions from Google, SW360 has the following guidelines for
GSoC contributors:
- **Usage of AI in proposal writing:** The proposal writing is a core part of
  the GSoC program and it should never be offloaded to the AI completely. This
  is the place where you would most probably meet the organization for the
  first time and show your creativity, so use this space wisely.
    + Generative AI usage is allowed, but to do tasks like formatting,
      rearranging, etc.
    + Usage of Generative AI is strictly prohibited for creating the proposal
      idea itself (includes the end goal, the approach) and proposal will be penalized if such usage found.
- **Usage of AI in coding:** We have seen in previous contributions that people
  do not install SW360 at all while they are working on their contributions. If
  you cannot see the tool, if you cannot test your changes, how can you
  validate the changes you have done are correct. It then becomes the
  responsibility of the maintainer to do a thorough testing, always, which
  takes more time than for the person contributing the changes. AI also does
  not know everything. Even if you are using coding agents to help you, but you
  cannot provide them the right input, their output will only be garbage.
    + For you first few PR, we require you to provide evidence of SW360
      installation by providing information like API version, SW360 version,
      screenshot/example output from the changes.
    + Taking help from AI is fine, but completely relying on it is not good for
      the project and for you.
    + Take suggestions from the AI, but always understand changes before
      pushing them. If you cannot understand the code generated, do not push it.
    + If you are pushing the code, you are responsible for it, it does not
      matter a human wrote it or an AI. Thus, take your contributions seriously. We like to work with humans more than machines.
    + If the code changes are not clear and without any human explanation, the
      maintainers hold the rights to close the PR without further explanation.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Last year SW360 did not had any acceptance criteria
  to make it easy for everyone to apply. However, this lead to number of
  proposals which became impossible to manage. Thus, starting this year, we
  want to add following to the list of criteria for your proposal to be
  considered:
    + There should be at least one contribution with significant enough changes
      (simple typo fix for example do not qualify).
    + If you could not have created a PR, you should at least had communicated
      with one of the Org member and they should vouch for you.

Please feel free to drop any questions here (or start a new discussion) you
have regarding the program, you want to submit a proposal idea, you want to be
a mentor in the program, etc.
