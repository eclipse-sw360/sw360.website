### SBOM Validator

**Goal:** Design and implement an SBOM Validator that ensures uploaded SBOMs
meet organizational and regulatory requirements by validating completeness,
consistency, and structure

The SBOM Validator processes SBOMs generated by different tools and provided in
various standard formats (such as SPDX and CycloneDX). It validates that all
mandated fields are present and correctly populated according to defined
policies and compliance requirements.

The validator may optionally convert incoming SBOMs into a standardized
internal representation. When enabled, this internal format is used to simplify
validation logic, ensure consistent behaviour across SBOM sources, and reduce
format-specific handling. When not enabled, validation can be performed
directly against the original SBOM structure.

During processing, the validator consolidates duplicate or overlapping packages
and components, resolving inconsistencies such as multiple representations of
the same dependency. Additionally, the validator supports SBOM enrichment by
augmenting existing data with derived or externally sourced information, such
as normalized package identifiers or additional metadata.

Before final import, users are provided with a clear graphical and navigable
visualization of the parsed and consolidated SBOM data instead of boaring flat
list view, allowing them to review structure, metadata, and detected issues.

In a summary:

* Validate SBOMs from multiple formats (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX) and generators
  for completeness and correctness.
* Ensure all mandated and policy-required fields are present and properly
  populated.
* Optionally normalize uploaded SBOMs into a standardized internal format to 
  simplify validation and ensure consistent processing.
* Provide a graphical visualization of SBOM data prior to import for user
  review.

### CLIXML visualizer for release attachments

**Goal:** The idea here is to provide a clearance report visualizer for the
CLIXML coming from FOSSology.

Currently, SW360 users must download separate CLIXML files or log into
FOSSology to understand the clearance status of a release. This feature would
allow SW360 to parse the CLIXML report directly within the browser. The key
features to this idea can be pointed out as follows:
* CLIXML Parser and UI Renderer in SW360
* If FOSSology can provide item ID in the report, provide a hyperlink to file
  directly. Next to every file listed in the SW360 preview, provide a "View in
  FOSSology" icon.
* Compare the CLIXML of the current release with the previous version.
  Highlight New Licenses or Changed Copyrights in red/green within the UI. This
  helps the user focus only on what has changed in the latest code drop.

### Integration of SW360 and LicenseDB

**Goal:** To establish LicenseDB as the sole source for all license and
obligation data within SW360, streamlining data management and ensuring
consistency.

Currently, SW360 relies on a fragmented approach for managing license and
obligation information. Licenses can be imported from external sources like
OSADL or SPDX, or created manually. Obligations, which define the requirements
associated with each license, can only be created manually within SW360. This
decentralized system can lead to inconsistencies, manual overhead, and
difficulty in maintaining a single, accurate view of license compliance.

This project aims to change how SW360 manages this data by integrating it
directly with LicenseDB. The successful completion of this project will
involve:
1. Removing Redundant Data Entry Methods: All existing functionalities within
   SW360 that allow for manual license creation or direct import from
   OSADL/SPDX will be deprecated and removed.
2. Integration: Develop a robust integration layer to enable SW360 to fetch
   license and obligation data directly from LicenseDB. This will likely
   involve:
   1. OAuth Integration: Implementing Machine-to-Machine OAuth flow between
      SW360 and LicenseDB.
   2. Data Translation/Mapping: Creating mechanisms to translate and map data
      structures from LicenseDB's format to SW360's internal data model for
      licenses and obligations.
   3. Data Persistence: Ensuring that the fetched data is correctly saved and
      updated within SW360's database for ongoing use and reference.
3. Adapting Existing Workflows: Review and modify existing SW360 CLI (Command 
   Line Interface) and XML-based workflows. These workflows currently create
   licenses and obligations if they don't already exist. They must be updated
   to leverage the new LicenseDB integration, ensuring they now fetch and sync
   data from LicenseDB rather than creating it independently.

### Remove Apache Thrift and Migrate to Direct Spring Service Calls

**Goal:** Eliminate Apache Thrift dependency from SW360 and replace
inter-service communication with direct Spring Bean injection and REST APIs.

SW360 currently uses Thrift for backend service communication (ThriftClients,
*Service.Iface). This adds complexity, requires .thrift IDL files, and creates
tight binary coupling. Migrate to Spring-managed services with direct injection
for in-process calls and REST for external integrations.

#### Current state vs Expected state
| Aspect          | Current State                                   | Expected State                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Service Layer   | Thrift IDL (.thrift files) generates interfaces | Plain Java interfaces with Spring @Service  |
| IPC Mechanism   | ThriftClients + THttpClient + TCompactProtocol  | Direct @Autowired injection (in-process)    |
| External API    | Thrift servlets (Sw360ThriftServlet)            | REST controllers (existing resource-server) |
| Dependencies    | libthrift, Thrift compiler toolchain            | Removed—pure Spring Boot                    |
| Code Generation | Required for model classes                      | POJOs, no generation step                   |

### Archival of Components and Projects

**Goal:** Creation of an archival and restore functionality to remove
unnecessary Projects and Components from SW360 server

As an SW360 instance grows over years of use, the database becomes cluttered
with "stale" projects and deprecated component versions that are no longer in
active use. This feature introduces an Archival Workflow. The archival workflow
should allow complete removal of a Project or Component or Release from the
SW360 server (with entire metadata like changelogs, attachments, etc.) into a
single compressed package (e.g., a ZIP or TAR containing JSON metadata), and
purges them from the active database. At the same time, there should be a
Workflow to restore these archived projects/components/releases individually
for the purpose of audit, reuse, etc. This archival process will allow usage of
cold storage backups and improve upon the performance of application by
reducing index size, speeds up UI responsiveness, and saves significant disk
space.

Feature points to consider:
* Comprehensive Data Bundling (The "Snapshot")
* Database Cleanup & Performance Optimization
* Seamless Re-Import & Restoration
* Archival Metadata Registry

### Project 360 view

**Goal:** To empower product owners and compliance teams with a single, trusted
source of compliance truth

Project 360° View delivers a holistic compliance dashboard for both parent and
child projects, offering complete visibility into software usage, security
risks, and license obligations. 

It consolidates vulnerability data across the entire project hierarchy, clearly
highlighting severity levels, affected components, and overall compliance
impact. 
All license and obligation information is aggregated to identify notice,
disclosure, and copyleft requirements, ensuring legal and regulatory adherence. 

The view also presents approved and pending releases, along with clearing
request and legal approval status, giving product owners a clear picture of
release readiness. 
Additionally, all compliance-relevant changes since the last release—including
newly introduced components, license changes, new vulnerabilities, and removed
items—are tracked and visualized. 

By unifying security, legal, and release data into a single interface, Project
360° View enables faster audits, reduces compliance risk, and supports
confident, data-driven release decisions. 

- Provide a good overview of the project to the product owners. 
- Project 360° View provides a hierarchical compliance view of parent and child

### Customize Copy Project

**Goal:** Idea is to allow users to provide fields they want to carry over
while using the "Copy Project" feature

Currently, when a user wants to use duplicate/copy projects to create, lets say
a new version, they do not have a choice of fields to be carried over. SW360
copies all and everything to the new Project and the user has to manually make
sure everything is up-to-date.

This new feature will allow users to pick and choose the fields they want to
carry over into the new Project and leave the rest. To implement this feature,
the changes would have to be done at both front-end and back-end side.

### Provide alternative Component link

**Goal:** Provide a data structure to deprecate a Component and provide link to
new Component.

Depending on how Admins are using the SW360 instance, they want to manage the
Component naming/grouping in a different way. There can also be scenarios where
an OSS project decided to rename themselves over period. In such cases, you
might want to mark a Component as deprecated and provide an alternative to be
used instead.

All this information still needs to be preserved and documented in SW360 but
needs to be machine-readable as well. When using automation to generate SBOM
and import in SW360 like with [capycli](https://github.com/sw360/capycli),
adding all such customization makes them tool specific and someone using
different tool might not understand this.

The main idea of this project is to provide such fields in the Component
DataStructure where user can mark a Component (and all its Releases) as
deprecated. At the same time, make it easy to provide link to alternatives to
be used. Such information, when provided over REST API, can be used by frontend
to display information like bellow. At the same time allow tools to use this
information to make smart decisions. As an add-on, SW360 can be allowed to
completely disallow changes in deprecated Components and use the alternative
instead to create new Releases.
